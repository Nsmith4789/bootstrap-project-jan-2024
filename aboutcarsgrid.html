                Mustang GT Ford has delivered its seventh chapter of its storied Mustang muscle car with
                reworked-but-familiar styling, revised chassis hardware, an all-new interior, and two improved
                powertrains. While the new pony is saddled up for the future with a bevy of upgrades, the long-term fate
                of its closest competitors, the Chevy Camaro and Dodge Challenger, isn’t as rosy. The new-gen car
                continues to be powered by a 5.0-liter V-8, this time with output cranked to 480 horsepower. A 315-hp
                turbocharged 2.3-liter EcoBoost is also an improvement over last, but only slightly. Both powertrains
                come with a 10-speed automatic, but only the V-8 can be optioned with a six-speed manual transmission.
                Hardtop coupe and soft top convertible bodystyles are available too. The Mustang’s rethought cockpit and
                beefed-up engine choices keep the muscle car story alive. After driving all of the new Mustang's
                variants, we're convinced it's Editors' Choice material.

                Toyota Supra (wider)While most of Toyota's lineup consists of consumer-grade sedans and SUVs, models
                marked with the initials GR represent the automaker's highest levels of performance, and chief among
                that subset is the 2024 GR Supra. While it's based on—and built alongside—the BMW Z4 convertible, the
                Supra brings an entirely different curb appeal that helped land it on our 2024 Editors' Choice list. The
                two share most everything else though, including 255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder and 382-hp
                turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engines. All Supra models are rear-wheel drive and you can have
                either an eight-speed automatic or, as we prefer, a six-speed manual. The interior borrows heavily from
                the BMW parts bin—either a good or bad thing depending on who you ask. But it comes with few compromises
                and there's plenty of space for two adults to get comfortable even on long drives. The Supra's sharp
                handling and responsive powertrains, however, mean its happier nipping apexes than long highway slogs.

                BMW M5
                Some cars are big-bodied and some are thrilling. The BMW M5 is both, with a body based on the regular
                5-series and a heart-and-lung transplant courtesy of the brand's M performance division. Under the hood
                lives a spectacular 600-hp twin-turbo V-8 bolted to an eight-speed automatic transmission that powers
                all four wheels. An optional Competition package turns up the heat with 17 extra horsepower, a more
                soulful exhaust, stiffer suspension, and Competition badging and trim. That version rocketed to 60 mph
                in 2.8 seconds in our testing. Built to handle the rigors of mountain hairpins, blasts on the autobahn,
                and everyday life the M5 offers a premium experience with a penchant for fireworks. Unlike its closest
                competitor, the Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing, the Bimmer's stealthy packaging isn't offset by a thunderous
                exhaust but its impressive comfort and refinement make it among the best in the premium sports sedan
                segment.

                Bugatti Veyron
                As the follow-up to the legendary Veyron, the 2021 Chiron takes the brand's heritage and its
                predecessor's performance and melds them together into one stunning—and stunningly capable—machine. The
                Chiron's nearly $3 million price tag matches its extreme persona, but even for that kind of money it's
                almost a performance bargain. It's powered by a massive 16-cylinder engine that is a marvel of modern
                engineering, capable of propelling this hypercar to 300 mph and beyond. Besides performance that can
                alter time, the Chiron looks like nothing else on the road—save for maybe a Veyron—and its interior is
                lined with fine materials worthy of its price tag. No, this beauty doesn't offer Apple CarPlay or a
                semi-autonomous driving mode but really, who cares? The Chiron is simply not weighed down by the same
                practical expectations and requirements as something as plebian as a Lamborghini or a McLaren—which
                allows it to be all of autodom's halo car.

                Corrvette Z06 (wider)
                Neighbors two blocks away agree that the 670-hp Chevrolet Corvette Z06's cold startup screams good
                morning, America! The set of pipes attached to Chevy's naturally-aspirated, flat-plane crank 5.5-liter
                V-8 is nothing short of symphonious, and its parade of horsepower and circular-saw exhaust note
                celebrates the existence of the greatest Corvette ever built. The Z06 is the most aggressive version of
                the Corvette Stingray and, although it's still a worthy daily driver, its sharper set of track day tools
                has turned what was already a great car into a predator. The Z06 is 3.5 inches wider than the Stingray,
                has an 8500 rpm redline, and offers optional carbon-fiber wheels fitted to Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R
                ZP race rubber that measures more than 13.5 inches wide at the rear. The Z06 offers the sort of stunning
                performance you find in ultra-expensive exotics such as the Ferrari 296GTB, but at the much lower
                starting price of a Porsche Cayman GT4. It's this blend of performance and value that has made the
                Corvette Z06 a regular on our annual Editors' Choice list.

                Acura NSX
                Acura's flagship isn't a large sedan or even a decked-out full-size SUV; it's the 2022 NSX Type S sports
                car, which utilizes a hybrid powertrain. A twin-turbo V-6 and three electric motors team up for
                blistering acceleration but the system also enables quiet, electric-only driving so your neighbors don't
                have a cow every time you idle through your subdivision. Other similarly-priced sports cars such as the
                McLaren 570S and the Mercedes-AMG GT offer sharper handling or more raw power, but the NSX is easier to
                live with on a day-to-day basis. Of course, there are some downsides, including the dated cabin and
                infotainment system; the NSX's interior storage is also not generous.
