            <h5 class="card-title">Mustang GT</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American
                manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird[8] (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and
                Dodge Challenger[9] (1970). It also competed with the Plymouth Barracuda, which was launched around the
                same time. The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupes worldwide, leading to the marketing of
                the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury
                Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during the 1970s,
                it included more features and was marketed as a personal luxury car.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Toyota Supra</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978
                to 2002. The fifth
                generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the
                original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was longer.[5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70
                Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and
                named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken
                for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at
                the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in
                Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by
                Magna Steyr.</p>

            <P>The BMW M5 is a high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. It is
                considered an iconic vehicle in the sports sedan category.[1][2] The majority of M5s have been produced
                in
                the sedan (saloon) body style, but in some countries the M5 was also available as a wagon (estate) from
                1992
                to 1995 and from 2006 to 2010.[3][4] The first BMW M5, based on the E28 5 Series, was manufactured from
                October 1984 to June
                1988.[7] It made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show in February 1985.[8] It was based on the 535i
                chassis with various mechanical changes, most notably the M88/3 engine (shared with the E24 M635CSi
                grand tourer coupé) which was an updated version of the engine used in the M1 sports car.[7] At its
                launch, the E28 M5 was the fastest production sedan in the world.[5]</P>

            <p>The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed and developed in Germany by Bugatti
                Engineering GmbH[8] and manufactured in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti
                Automobiles S.A.S. The successor to the Bugatti Veyron,[9] the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva
                Motor Show on 1 March 2016.[10][11] The car's design was initially previewed with the Bugatti Vision
                Gran Turismo concept car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show.[12] The main carry over component
                from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily
                updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm
                and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[14]</p>
